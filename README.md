# SIS Certificates 🎓

### Welcome to the **SIS Certificates** repository! 🎉

This repository is used to store e-certificates for our events.  
Participants can find and download their certificates here.

## 📜 How It Works
- Certificates are organized by batch, following the format:
  `certificates_batch_YYYY-MM-DD`
- Each batch corresponds to a specific event or issuance date.
- Simply navigate to the relevant folder and find your certificate.

## 🔍 Looking for Your Certificate?
1. Go to the `certificates_batch_YYYY-MM-DD` folder matching your event date.
2. Search for your certificate file (named after your registered name).
3. Download and keep a copy for your records.
4. Use the link attached in your respective emails and attach it on LinkedIn.
