# SIS Certificates 🎓

### Welcome to the **SIS Certificates** repository! 🎉

This repository is used to store e-certificates for our events.  
Participants can find and download their certificates here.
The link as well as the pdf to be downloaded should already be present in the email sent to you

## 📜 How It Works
- Certificates are organized by batch, following the format:
  `SIS <<MONTH>> OD<<YEAR>>_SISKL Certs` or `SIS <<MONTH>> OD<<YEAR>>_SCKL_SU Certs`
- Each batch corresponds to a specific event or issuance date.
- Simply navigate to the relevant folder and find your certificate.

## 🔍 Looking for Your Certificate?
1. Go to the `SIS <<MONTH>> OD<<YEAR>>_SISKL Certs` folder matching your event date.
2. Search for your certificate file (the letters after the underscore are your initials).
3. Download and keep a copy for your records.
4. Use the link attached in your respective emails and attach it on LinkedIn.
